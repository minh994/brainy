## Known Issues
- 🐛 MissingPluginException with SharedPreferences (fixed)
- 🐛 Duplicate service implementations (fixed)
- 🐛 SignupView parameter count mismatch (fixed)
- 🐛 SignupView not using BaseView pattern (fixed)
- 🐛 Incorrect authentication flow after signup (fixed) - Now redirects to login since the API doesn't return tokens on signup

## Architecture Evolution
Our architecture has evolved from a simple MVC to a full MVVM implementation with:
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Testable view models
3. Reusable base components
4. Dependency injection
5. Repository pattern
6. Consistent error handling
7. Feature-focused directory structure

## Next Release Goals
1. Complete authentication flow with auto-login and token refresh
2. Implement vocabulary list and detail features
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Improve UI/UX with consistent components
