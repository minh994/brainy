## Architecture Evolution
Our architecture has evolved from a simple MVC to a full MVVM implementation with:
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Testable view models
3. Reusable base components
4. Dependency injection
5. Repository pattern
6. Consistent error handling
7. Feature-focused directory structure
8. Enum-based standardization for type safety

## Next Release Goals
1. Complete authentication flow with auto-login and token refresh
2. Implement interactive learning exercises
3. Add word learning progress tracking
4. Improve offline functionality
5. Enhance UI/UX with animations and transitions
