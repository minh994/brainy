## Architecture Evolution
Our architecture has evolved from a simple MVC to a full MVVM implementation with:
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Testable view models
3. Reusable base components
4. Dependency injection
5. Repository pattern
6. Consistent error handling
7. Feature-focused directory structure
8. Enum-based standardization for type safety
9. Category-lesson hierarchical structure for grammar content

## Next Release Goals
1. Complete authentication flow with auto-login and token refresh
2. Implement interactive learning exercises
3. Add word learning progress tracking
4. Enhance the grammar feature with interactive exercises
5. Improve offline functionality with content caching
6. Enhance UI/UX with animations and transitions
