# Project Brief

## Project Overview
Brainy is a mobile application for language learning with a focus on vocabulary acquisition. It is built using Flutter for cross-platform functionality (iOS and Android) and connects to a REST API backend for content and user management.

## Project Objectives
1. Create a user-friendly language learning application
2. Implement a clean, maintainable MVVM architecture
3. Deliver a responsive, performant mobile experience
4. Enable users to learn vocabulary efficiently through context
5. Provide proper user authentication and progress synchronization

## Key Requirements
1. **Authentication System**
   - User registration and login
   - Secure token-based authentication
   - Profile management

2. **Vocabulary Management**
   - Categorized word lists
   - Word details with examples
   - Progress tracking per word

3. **Learning Features**
   - Interactive exercises
   - Spaced repetition algorithm
   - Progress analytics

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Flutter for cross-platform support
   - Clean architecture (MVVM)

2. Clean, well-documented source code
3. User authentication system
4. Core learning features
5. API integration
6. Basic analytics

## Success Criteria
1. App performs well on both iOS and Android devices
2. Clean, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns
3. Authentication and data synchronization work reliably
4. Users can effectively manage and learn vocabulary
5. The app meets all specified requirements
