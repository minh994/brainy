# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are enhancing the user experience and functionality of the Brainy Flutter app, with focus on:
1. Improving the Dictionary view with advanced filtering and part of speech visualization
2. Adding audio playback functionality for pronunciation
3. Creating a comprehensive Settings screen
4. Optimizing API integration with proper error handling

## Recent Changes
- Implemented a word status filtering system using an enum-based approach
- Added color-coded part of speech indicators (noun, verb, adjective) in the Dictionary view
- Created a Settings screen with theme, language, notification, and learning preferences
- Integrated the just_audio package for word pronunciation
- Updated API response handling for nested JSON structures
- Improved filter chip UI with better visual feedback for active state
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Optimized the dictionary word item layout with cleaner design

## Active Decisions
- Using color-coding for parts of speech (POS):
  - Noun: Purple
  - Verb: Blue
  - Adjective: Green
  - Other parts of speech have distinct colors for quick identification

- Using WordStatus enum for standardization:
  - Provides type safety
  - Ensures consistent status names
  - Simplifies filtering logic

- Implementing separate API calls for status counts:
  - More network requests but better separation of concerns
  - Makes error handling more granular
  - Allows for independent updates of counts

- Using just_audio for pronunciation:
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Simple API
  - Support for streaming audio

- Settings design choices:
  - Organized by category (Appearance, Language, Sound, etc.)
  - Using shared_preferences for persistence
  - Immediate application of settings when changed

## Technical Debt
- Audio playback needs more robust error handling
- Need to add handling for network connectivity issues
- Potential optimization for API calls (batch requests)
- Need for comprehensive unit tests for view models
- Consider implementing more robust state management if needed

## Next Steps
1. Improve performance of the Dictionary view with virtualized lists
2. Add search history and favorites functionality
3. Implement word learning progress tracking
4. Create more interactive learning exercises
5. Add offline mode with data caching
6. Enhance accessibility features
7. Implement user analytics to track learning progress
